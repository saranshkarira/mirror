Gaining situational conformity for an interaction with a subject by looking for the reflections of the interactions of other people in past with the subject in the expectations of the subject.

This is something that happens on subconscious level.
Let's take your favourite example,
you're out with a girl, she's coming back to your place and you jokingly mention "God! Now I'll have to walk you back in the night", now this pretty babe might respond with yes/no or something funny but her reasoning at subconscious level goes something like :
"Uhmm! So girls usually go back to their homes by the end of the night and not sleep with this guy, cause clearly that's what his behaviour shows that he's used to"

At the end of the day, it all comes down to how every human is wired, how any intelligent machine works.
You come across something unknown, something new, say some weird metallic cylinder, assume it to be something it resembles to, say a bottle, then you poke it to test your assumptions.

One of the reasons imitators fail, they are simply bad imitations

Say you get all tattooed up, piercings, leather jackets and boots, neck-piece. Congrats you look like a stud, but you'll fail if you just look the part and not be it. Now if a babe sees you, what she sees is an stud, but she's gonna test it, the fact that you are in fact who she assumes you are. How far? depends on the self-worth, experience and thus the resulting level of scepticism.

If a wine bottle looks a hundred years old but tastes like shit, it's a fucking fake !

Let's bring this back to you, if you are trying to be different, a better person, often, if things are going haywire instead only means things work differently for this new person, different expectations,
So if something indeed doesn't work, instead of whining that it doesn't work, immediately deal with the aftermath how this new person would unless whining is what he'd do.
