There's an interesting allure to prophets, every fucking religion has it. Not a god but a man, a recurrent figure, a template, an archetype who rises time and time again, sailing mankind through the rivers of great sorrow. Of course Christians, Muslims and Jews have it, Hindus call him an avatar, Buddhists call him a Buddha(There are a lot of Buddhas).

This template seems to have been bestowed with a unique knowledge, a gift from above, a higher direction perhaps. Almost always there's a need create a following around this template, a cult, a religion even, to show that the group at least shares some of the bestowed fruit, so it could be immortalised and followed through eternia.


Like a complex beehive, that's spread even across time. 
Every religion is, every nation is and instead of pheromones, we follow ideas.
