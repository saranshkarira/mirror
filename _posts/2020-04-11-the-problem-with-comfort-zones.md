Here's an alternate perspective.
The idea of increasing your comfort zone is misunderstood. Badly.
Let's take a room, tightly packed with balloons. Red balloons.
Place a person in the centre of each one. Each balloon is the comfort zone of the person at the centre of it. Now in presence of others, such as in this tightly packed situation, in order to raise your comfort zone, there's only one way.
Shrink other's zones so yours could take up their place.

So increasing your comfort zone means keeping the boundaries of people around you small. 
That means being highly intolerant towards them, not tolerating even one small fucking mistake. Your zone expands only when you make other's zone shrink.

Basically, eat (zones) or get (your zone) eaten.
